        <h3><em>A sampling of music and podcasts I've recorded</em></h3>

        <p>Here are some audio files I've recorded in the recent past. I like to write and record my
        own songs as well as some covers by artists and bands I like. I also have done a couple of
        podcasts here and there. I would like to find a niche for podcasting and focus on providing
        quality content that is informative as well as entertaining.</p><br>
        
        <p>You can check out some originals I've recorded over at my Soundcloud <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-101416784" target="_blank">Here</a> (Link opens in a new window.)</p><br>
        
        <p>Stay tuned for podcasts, which are coming soon!</p><br>
