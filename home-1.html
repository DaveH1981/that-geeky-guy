    <p>Hi, everyone. My name is Dave and I'm the person behind this website. I
      am a web developer by trade and created this site to show off some of my
      technical skills.</p>

    <p>While I do consider myself a developer, I am also equally invested in the
      design side of things. Coming from an artistic background, namely music
      and drawing, it is very important to me for the websites I design to be
      beautiful as well as functional and easy to navigate.</p><br>

    <h3>What can I do for you?</h3>

    <p>At this point, you are probably wondering what kind of sites I design
      and possibly what I can do for you. Well, if you're interested, I've
      designed everything from ecommerce websites to blogs and personal vanity
      sites. I do consulting and advising as well. One time, I had a client who
      ran a dating site geared toward professional women and sought my input in
      redesigning it.</p><br>
