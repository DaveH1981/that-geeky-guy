    <p>I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. I started coding in HTML
    and CSS in 2011 when I was looking to learn a new skill. Although I was
    having fun playing drums in rock bands, between that and odd jobs, I was
    making very little money and wanted to change that.</p><br>

    <p>Although just learning basic HTML and CSS was fairly daunting at first,
    I soon got the hang of it and moved on to plain vanilla JavaScript. That
    proved even more challenging, but I persevered and it paid off. Before I
    knew it, I was coding entire web pages from scratch and it felt great.
    Not only had I discovered a new outlet for my creative energy, but I also
    felt a sense of accomplishment and competency with my newly acquired
    skillset. Most of all, making websites is fun and I'm so glad I learned
    how to do it.</p><br><br>
